# Network Packet Analysis with Wireshark

## Overview

Wireshark is used in a wide range of scenarios and not strictly for security reasons. However, this tool is so versatile it has major applications in both offensive and defensive security, where it can be used to view packets in their entirety. This is a very useful ability that you may also discover on other network appliances, especially UTMs. Because Wireshark, like NMAP, is a ubiquitous security tool featured in security certifications like CEH, it will help your career to get a jumpstart on it here. Today you will perform network packet analysis using Wireshark.
