# Lab: Malware Traffic Analysis with Wireshark 

## Overview

Malware analysts use sandboxed lab environments to study malware behavior. You need not be a dedicated malware researcher to be tasked with the same; oftentimes post-incident activities necessitate an investigation activity in which you scrutize all minutiae of evidence in an effort to better prepare for next time.

> "In June 2017, there were 1,726 job postings for malware analysts for which only 52 candidates applied. This is because malware analysis is an arduous process, requiring a wealth of knowledge, a lot of patience, and, occasionally, disruptive thinking." -[Toolbox.com](https://www.toolbox.com/security/data-security/articles/what-is-malware-analysis-definition-types-stages-best-practices/)

Today you will download a set of data from a scenario and analyze the data to determine what took place, and report your findings.
