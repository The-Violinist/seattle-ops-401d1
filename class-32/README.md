# XSS, SQL Injection

## Overview

In the early days of computing, authentication systems were constructed without a serious concern for resilience to attack. Passwords were not held to a minimum standard of complexity, and user inputs in web forms were not validated to avoid attack techniques such as XSS and SQLi. Now, however, we have entire frameworks and toolkits available to us to ensure software application security (AppSec) meets modern expectations.

Today, you will practice XSS and SQLi to better understand some of the most common AppSec security concerns.
