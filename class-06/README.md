# Data file encryption and hashing

## Overview

Today you will learn how to assure (and attack) confidentiality and integrity at the single-file level. You will practice the exfiltration and transmissions of hashed files. If the organization needs to protect sensitive information, the security professional should be prepared with solutions to facilitate the confidentiality and integrity of a given data.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

### Part 1: Staging

Prepare the following operating systems for today's lab:
- Deploy a Linux VM on a cloud provider of your choosing. Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Focal Fossa works fine for this.

  > Tip: AWS Lightsail has some very fast, easy Linux AMIs to spin up for this segment of the lab.

- In your Linux VM install OpenSSH
- In Microsoft Azure, deploy the AdventureWorks sample SQL database
- On your local PC install Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and establish connectivity to your AdventureWorks SQL DB.

The remaining lab requirements will be unlocked at noon on Class-06.
