# Automated AppSec with OWASP Zap

## Overview

Application security, or AppSec, encompasses everything software security. Decisions made during the software development lifecycle (SDLC) can dramatically impact the level of security present in the released application. To test web application security, we can use tools like OWASP ZAP to automate the attack procedure.
