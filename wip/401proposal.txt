## Lab Requirements

1.
#### Cyber Case Studies

  1. The Ops 401 Instructor will need access to cyber case studies for various activities which require students to analyze security in realistic business scenarios.
  2. Why use cyber case studies in a hands-on course?
    1. Always challenge students to present findings within the context of the business. We can teach tools, yes, but teaching tools in realistic contexts is better!
    2. [Journal of Cybersecurity Education, Research and Practice Volume 2018 | Number 2 Article 3 | Date 12-31-2018: Using Case Studies To Teach Cybersecurity Courses](https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&amp;context=jcerp)

    2. [SANS Whitepapers Case Studies](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/casestudies/)
2.
#### Virtual/Cloud Environments

  1. VMware
    1. Most labs unless it is explicitly a topical cloud day can be performed in VMware by running multiple VMware instances at once. A licensed copy of VMware Workstation will improve the experience but is not required.
  2. Amazon Web Services
    1. Plan A: Explore the [AWS Educate program](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/educators/) to see what services are available for educational businesses like ourselves.
    2. Plan B: Use AWS Free Tier at the per-student level
  3. Microsoft Azure
    1. Plan A: Explore the [Microsoft Education Partnership](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/education) program to see what services are available for educational businesses like ourselves.
    2. Plan B: Have students use [Azure free trials](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
1.
#### Targetable Systems

  1. HackTheBox
    1. Requires a free membership which is achieved by beating the first challenge (solution is online).
    2. Machines are accessible after you VPN into a region of theirs from you Kali box.

  3. Lecture
    1. Why use **Public key infrastructure (PKI)** (ref [SSH.com](https://www.ssh.com/pki/))
      1. Today&#39;s security professional, particularly at the entry level, needs to have a firm grasp of how and why PKI is used in various systems today.
      2. Secure websites

      4. Email signing and encryption
    2. What is PKI?
      1. &quot;Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world. The basic idea is to have one or more trusted parties digitally sign documents certifying that a particular cryptographic key belongs to a particular user or device. The key can then be used as an identity for the user in digital networks.&quot; (ref [SSH.com](https://www.ssh.com/pki/))
      2. Security functional purpose of PKI

        1. CA = Certificate Authority
      4. Types
        1. Symmetric
          1. Advantage: Faster
          2. Examples: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256
        2. Asymmetric
          1. Advantage: Nonrepudiation
            1. The sender and receiver vouch for who they are with their own private keys
          2. Examples: RSA, DSA, and PKCS
        3. Symmetric
          1. Advantage: Faster
        4. Examples: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256
      5. Diagram: CA role in client-server PKI

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_c1bde9edc8a2c9d3.png)

1. Make sure students can associate an action they take in lab to a process illustrated in the whiteboard diagram you draw for them

    1. How is PKI used?
      1. Secure websites with HTTPS

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_8a0f5a99a6106aa4.png)

        1. Discuss why is HTTPS so important to have on all public-facing webservers
          1. HTTP is cleartext data transmission between you and the server
            1. Glaring reminder that the internet was not designed for security purposes
          2. HTTPS is easy to implement so why not?
          3. Increase end-user confidence in web server security = better experience on your website
          4. Good for defending against MITM and session hijacking although not a perfect defense
        2. Why don&#39;t all sites use HTTPS?
          1. Show students the [Why No HTTPS](https://www.troyhunt.com/why-no-https-heres-the-worlds-largest-websites-not-redirecting-insecure-requests/) site
          2. Example: Navigate to Boeing.com (or any site without HTTPS but obviously should have it)
            1. The lack of HTTPS can lead to negative press about your brand
            2. If a company fails to implement a simple protocol like HTTPS, this does not inspire public confidence in the org&#39;s security policies and capabilities
            3. Do your company a favor and champion HTTPS
        3. How to protect yourself
          1. HTTPSONLY browser addon
        4. How to install HTTPS on a web site you develop
          1. [Google Developer Article - How to Set up HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/enable-https)
      1. Certificates
        1. Windows Server supports CA and certificate assignment
        2. OpenSSL
      2. Authenticating users and computers with SSH (ref. [AWS SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html))
      3. Email signing and encryption using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
        1. OpenPGP is the most current version
          1. Original PGP developed in the 90s
        2. Backwards compatibility means possibility of downgrade attack
        3. PGP is largely considered an insecure encryption method today but sees widespread use
      4. Example use case for PKI certificates
        1. Your organization is subject to export compliance regulation by the US government. The compliance officer must submit export compliance reports regularly to DECCS, but her computer is prompting for a certificate to validate her identity. Research DECCS policy and diagram the process. (Solution: [DECCS FAQ](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/deccs?id=ddtc_public_portal_faq_detail&amp;sys_id=fd856da2db5a2700529d368d7c9619fa))

### Week 3 - Cloud and Network Security

Overview

This week, we&#39;ll get some practice with some foundational open source security tools Wireshark and Snort. Next, we&#39;ll spin up a VPC in AWS, deploy a Ubuntu Linux Server AMI, harden the Ubuntu AMI using best practice procedures, and create an interface for traffic mirroring. Using that interface, we&#39;ll replicate our local network skills in the cloud by running Security Onion for packet analysis and Suricata for IDS. By the end of this week, students will be able to perform packet analysis and IDS/IPS administration in both LAN and cloud environments.

1.
#### Day 11 - Network Packet Analysis with Wireshark

  1. Notes
    1. Wireshark is used in a wide range of scenarios and not strictly for security reasons. However, this tool is so versatile it has major applications in both offensive and defensive security, where it can be used to view packets in their entirety. This is a very useful ability that you may also discover on other network appliances, especially UTMs. Because Wireshark, like NMAP, is a ubiquitous security tool featured in security certifications like CEH, it will help a student&#39;s career to get a jumpstart on it here.

            1. Use Wireshark to record an HTTP GET request to [https://1112.net/lastpage.html](https://1112.net/lastpage.html) to capture the HTML text and tag contents of the page. Take a screenshot of your HTTP OK packet alongside your browser&#39;s inspection dump and paste into your deliverable.
          2. SOLUTION
            1. After navigating to the page, turn on recording and hit refresh on the browser. Stop recording.
            2. Compare the inspected site contents with the HTTP OK packet contents; they should match.
            3. Right click a packet and &quot;Follow TCP Stream&quot; to show entire conversation with site
            4. After closing you should be able to see the entire SYN/ACK handshake process on all packets
        3. Lab scenario 3
          1. CHALLENGE
            1. Deploy an FTP server external to your PC. Create an account with credentials you&#39;ve never used before. Dumb credentials are fine.
            2. Using Wireshark, demonstrate why FTP is not a secure protocol.
          2. SOLUTION
            1. Bring up the FTP login SSH CLI.
            2. Turn on Wireshark packet capture recording.
            3. Login to the FTP with credentials.
            4. Stop Wireshark recording.
            5. Packets will contain credentials.
            6. Save a screencap of your credentials (assuming not shared/private to your accounts) to the deliverable.

#### Day 14 - Cloud Network Traffic Analysis

  1. Notes
    1. Today&#39;s lab is inspired by this excellent [traffic mirroring article](https://medium.com/@wan0net/deploying-security-onion-on-amazon-web-services-aws-using-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-mirroring-5f336dcd6312) which allows students to take the network packet analysis concepts learned prior in the week and apply them to a cloud environment.

  1. Lecture
    1. Why use traffic mirroring?
      1. Monitor packet traffic in the cloud
    2. What is traffic mirroring?
      1. Clones network traffic you&#39;re interested in and sends it to your capture tool
      2. Deploy sensors on AWS cloud to capture, analyze, and alert on suspicious network activity
      3. Mimic the traffic monitoring tool Wireshark but on AWS cloud instead
    3. What is Security Onion?
      1. &quot;Security Onion is an open source Linux distribution designed to be deployed as a network monitoring sensor. It comes with a host of open source tools such as Suricata, Zeek, Elasticsearch, and that stalwart of packet analysis, Wireshark. It&#39;s easy to deploy (although a little trickier in this instance, more on that later), and can provide you with a quick and effective network monitoring tool to build your capability off of.&quot; -Medium.com [traffic mirroring article](https://medium.com/@wan0net/deploying-security-onion-on-amazon-web-services-aws-using-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-mirroring-5f336dcd6312)
  2. Lab
    1. Configure Traffic Mirroring on the VPC
    2. Install [Security Onion](https://securityonion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases.html) on top of Ubuntu Linux Server machine
      1. Use the[&quot;quick and dirty&quot; instructions](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/InstallingOnUbuntu)
      2. Create traffic mirror target (ref. [traffic mirroring article](https://medium.com/@wan0net/deploying-security-onion-on-amazon-web-services-aws-using-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-mirroring-5f336dcd6312) for these steps)
      3. Create traffic mirror filter
      4. Create traffic mirror session
      5. &quot;Now we find out if it&#39;s working. Login to the Security Onion sensor, and see if you can see packets coming in to the monitoring interface through tshark. You will also be able to see it through the Elasticsearch interface, and if there&#39;s any malicious activity against your VPC you&#39;ll hopefully see it there too.&quot; -Medium.com [traffic mirroring article](https://medium.com/@wan0net/deploying-security-onion-on-amazon-web-services-aws-using-virtual-private-cloud-vpc-mirroring-5f336dcd6312)

### Week 4 - Threat Modeling and Analysis

During this week, students are put into the shoes of an enterprise security team to perform mission critical tasks such as threat analysis, threat modeling, and threat hunting. The ability to use today&#39;s most relevant frameworks, tools, and resources will be emphasized. Students will hone their ability to communicate threat information to other teams and non-technical stakeholders as the week culminates in a presentation of a fully modeled and analyzed attack technique.

There are two communicative audiences we want students prepared for:

- Executives/non-technical
- Other technical teams

The instructor&#39;s role this week includes:

- Prepare a number of cyber scenario case studies for students to use.
  - Scenario descriptions will need to be extremely detailed and designed for students to analyze and extrapolate processes from. SANS WhitePapers are a great resource here.
  - If students research their own case study, it must be detailed enough to support being decomposed into frameworks
- Prepare web app security case studies for students to use for day 18, if their case study is not a web app scenario
- Teach critical concepts, jargon during lecture, e.g. what&#39;s an &quot;adversary&quot;
  - Seize opportunities to overlap communication, documentation, and technical skills to emulate real job scenarios
- Demonstrate example mapping processes during lecture
  - Involve students as much as possible
- Support students and teams during labs to ensure they are progressing and not getting stuck or hung up

    1. What is a threat (ref. [G2.com](https://learn.g2.com/threat-modeling))?
      1. &quot;A threat refers to any method that unapproved parties can use to gain access to sensitive information, networks and applications. Some of these threats may take the form of computer viruses, botnets, application attacks and phishing scams, among others.&quot;
      2. Examples include malware, DDoS, phishing
    2. What is threat analysis (ref. [NICE framework](https://niccs.us-cert.gov/workforce-development/cyber-security-workforce-framework/threat-analysis))?
      1. &quot;[Threat analysis] identifies and assesses the capabilities and activities of cybersecurity criminals or foreign intelligence entities; produces findings to help initialize or support law enforcement and counterintelligence investigations or activities.&quot;
    3. Why use a cyber kill-chain?
      1. Understand and combat ransomware, security breaches, and advanced persistent threats (APTs)
    4. What is an APT?

      1. Criticism of this model
        1. Too malware-focused
        2. Too perimeter-focused
    1. How is the Cyber Kill-Chain applied?
      1. Given an attack scenario, we can use this framework to illustrate an attack in detail at various critical stages
      2. Demo: Model the infamous Stuxnet worm (ref. [Techrepublic&#39;s article](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/stuxnet-the-smart-persons-guide/), [SANS ICS Stuxnet case study](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/ICS/industrial-control-system-cyber-kill-chain-36297)) into the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill-Chain
        1. Reconnaissance
        2. Weaponization
        3. Delivery
        4. Exploitation
        5. Installation
        6. Command and Control
        7. Actions on Objectives
      3. Fun video: [YouTube Zero Day Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VgIayOpjEc) - This is basically Stuxnet the movie, produced in 2016. The full movie is on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Days-Colonel-Gary-Brown/dp/B01I2EJOW0).
      4. &quot;In the Stuxnet campaign there is a completed two-stage ICS attack that led to the highly tailored and impactful manipulation of the process to cause physical destruction. The campaign ultimately reached all layers of the Purdue Model and represents a worst-case scenario of a completed ICS Cyber Kill Chain against a victim. The attack is mapped to the Purdue Model and illustrated in Figure 7.&quot;

        3. What happened?
        4. What systems or data were compromised?
        5. When did this take place?
        6. Where did this take place?
        7. Why did the attacker do this?
        8. How was the attack methodically executed?
          1. Fully document all stages of the cyber kill chain, mapping the event into each stage including visuals and descriptions
            1. Create a professional visual depiction of the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill-Chain mapped to your scenario
          2. For each stage, explain how to break the chain?
            1. What could have been done to disrupt the attack and prevent it from proceeding into the next stage?
        9. Assess the defensive systems.
          1. What systems would have prevented the attack from occurring?
          2. What post-attack systems or policies should have been implemented? Research were they?

        1. Adversaries use TTPs: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
      1. &quot;ATT&amp;CK is a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior and taxonomy for adversarial actions across their lifecycle. ATT&amp;CK has several parts:&quot;
        1. PRE-ATT&amp;CK: Reconnaissance and infrastructure setup
        2. ATT&amp;CK: Enterprise IT networks and cloud
        3. ATT&amp;CK for Mobile: Behavior against mobile devices.
    1. How is MITRE ATT&amp;CK used for threat modeling (ref. [MITRE ATT&amp;CK Training Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/training/cti/))?
      1. Database commonly used by security teams to improve threat detection
      2. &quot;ATT&amp;CK can be used in several ways to help security operations, threat intelligence, and security architecture. See the getting started page for resources on how to start using ATT&amp;CK. Also check out the Resources section of the website and the blog for related projects and other material.&quot;

        3. Reproduce it
        4. Create a deliverable

  1. Lab
    1. Note: While the default lab assignment is to replicate the case study, another idea for this lab is to run a canned simulation from MITRE.
      1. Option A: Load Splunk SIEM with a preconfigured data set
      2. Option B: Load OpenStack with MITRE&#39;s BRAWL scenario
    2. Students should thoroughly document all the below steps
      1. On [https://attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org/), identify all relevant ATT&amp;CKs that apply to your case study, try to shoot for 2-3 techniques
      2. Complete the Atomic Testing Cycle

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_1dcbc21066d8ff6f.png)

        1. Choose a test for that technique
          1. In lab environment reproduce your technique. This should be a skill acquired from 301 (spinning up environments as needed)
          2. Document all tools and infrastructure involved
        2. Execute the test procedure
        3. Analyze your detections of the procedure
        4. Review ATT&amp;CK threat mitigation documentation
        5. Make improvements to your defenses

#### Day 18 - Web Application Threat Modeling with OWASP, DREAD

  1. Notes
    1. This day of web app modeling most closely mirrors [Haider Mahmood&#39;s Infosec Blog post: &quot;Application Threat Modeling using DREAD and STRIDE&quot;](https://haiderm.com/application-threat-modeling-using-dread-and-stride/). This class is probably more effective with a real-world web app example that students can dig into. Maybe we host a website with an attached database that is deliberately vulnerable, then provide the contextual scenario and turn students loose on this activity. But they should not need a technical approach to this; if they can derive and identify OWASP threats from a given text-based scenario, this is sufficient.
    2. It may be more interesting for the teams to be given separate scenarios so they can present them on Friday as a compact week-long project.
    3. Resources: [MISTI Intro to Threat Modeling](https://misti.com/infosec-insider/threat-modeling-what-why-and-how)
  2. Lecture
    1. Why use threat modeling (ref. [SecurityIntelligence.com](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/what-is-threat-modeling-and-how-does-it-impact-application-security/))?

      1. &quot;Threat modeling is the practice of identifying and prioritizing potential threats and security mitigations to protect something of value, such as confidential data or intellectual property. By continuously threat modeling applications, security teams can better protect apps while educating the development team and building a culture of security throughout the enterprise.&quot;
    3. Why use OWASP?
      1. Web application security evaluation
    4. What is OWASP ([OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/))?

      2. OWASP is best integrated with secure development practices but can also be used post-development
    6. Why use DREAD?
      1. DREAD facilitates the evaluation of various threats as risk ratings.
      2. Which threats are the greatest?
      3. Contributes to an overall security assessment report
    7. What is DREAD (ref. [Infosec Institute](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/qualitative-risk-analysis-dread-model/))?
      1. Qualitative risk analysis of a threat
      2. Attributes that DREAD assesses
        1. Damage potential (How much are the assets affected?)
        2. Reproducibility (How easily the attack can be reproduced?)
        3. Exploitability (How easily the attack can be launched?)
        4. Affected users (What&#39;s the number of affected users?)
        5. Discoverability (How easily the vulnerability can be found?)
    8. How is DREAD used?
      1. Demonstrate the creation of a DREAD matrix
    9. How can we create threat models?
      1. Demonstrate a threat model design process from a given scenario

        1. Process –
        2. Each process in a DFD is given a unique number where sub process will have a number prefixed with parent process number. Process means an entity that performs a specific task on a given data. Following is the shape for a process:

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_83003a39a142cd7b.png)

        1. Multiple process –
        2. This means process has sub process and the sub process number is prefixed by the parent process number. For example parent process number is 1. Then sub process will have number 1.1 and sub sub process will have number 1.1.1 and so on. Shape for Multiple process is as follows:

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_cfb69b7e0d8d391c.png)

        1. External entity –
        2. It can only interact at Entry point or exit point and is located outside the system. It may only interact with process or multiple process. It can be either source of data or destination of data. Below is the shape for an external entity used in DFD:

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_265c8ae4d3dd3692.png)

        1. Data store –
        2. It is the place where data is stored or from where data is retrieved. It can only interact with process or multiple process. Shape for Data Store is as follows:

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_e29f4a0f5dbf9624.png)

        1. Data flow –
        2. This is used to show the movement of data between the elements. Below is the shape for Data Flow:

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_e95d29e57f569e5d.png)

        1. Trust boundary –
        2. It is a boundary between trust levels or privileges. Following is the shape for trust boundary

![](RackMultipart20200826-4-12zalxu_html_be37be0471c46fe.png) :

        1. DFD starts with a overall context level diagram that represents the whole system as a single multiple process. Each node is then a more detailed DFD representing other processes.

### Week 6 - Incident Response &amp; Security information and event management (SIEM)

Overview

Again, we are in the shoes of a live cyber ops team in an enterprise environment. Now that we&#39;re able to analyze, decompose, and model threats, how do we build and operate an environment that facilitates active countermeasures including monitoring, threat hunting, and incident response? We&#39;ll need to implement the NIST four stages of incident response model.

- First we will deploy Splunk, a SIEM solution, to our environment to aggregate log intelligence across our environment. This will increase automation maturity of our detection systems.
- Next, we install Sysmon on Windows 10 endpoints to facilitate log gathering, and feed this data into Splunk.
- We&#39;ll learn how indicators of compromise (IoCs) are the red flags in this ecosystem, facilitating active threat engagement.
- This week students will perform hands-on threat hunting activities using relevant tools.

### Week 7 - Malware and Application Security

Overview

This week is focused on reading code, understanding the context of how various cyber tools are used, and being familiar with common types of malware and being able to analyze and identify an unknown piece of malware in a secure fashion. Because extensive libraries already exist for common security scenarios, this week emphasizes why and how tools are used, rather than strictly on how to develop them. Code-savvy students will have an opportunity to develop their own payloads but this is not required. The student&#39;s career path in cyber will ultimately determine the extent to which the student will need to be literate in a particular programming language, although it is generally a good idea to know Python, Powershell, and Linux Bash to be a well-rounded cyber professional. The operations learned in this week have positive connections with incident response and IT teams. Labs can easily be designed to scale up or down to student skill levels.

The tools and environments configured this week will carry over most directly into the final pentesting week of this program.

Some goals for this week include:

- Be able to setup a Python environment
  - Know how to use pip and sudo apt get
- Be able to write a simple Python script and execute it
- Be able to deploy cybersecurity tools, install prerequisite components, and execute the tools successfully
- Be able to run a static code analysis tool
- This week will set the stage for our penetration test week by preparing all tools for use
  - NMAP
  - Datasploit
  - Metasploit (e.g. convert a Metasploit Ruby code to Python)
- Ideas for end of this week capability
  - Be able to offensively deploy a keylogger
  - Be able to offensively deploy a RAT
  - Be able to use Flare toolkit to analyze malware
    - Identify the malware
    - Determine the malware type and purpose

### Week 8 - Vulnerability Analysis

Overview

In this week, we practice tools and resources used to determine what vulnerabilities exist in a given platform. The popular vulnerability scanner, Nessus, is applied in practice. NMAP is used as well. Vulnerability assessment operations are interwoven into the student&#39;s existing understanding of cyber defense practices.

1.
#### Day 36 - Scanning the OWASP BWA

  1. Notes
    1. Today&#39;s class is all about exploring the OWASP Top Ten Web App Vulnerabilities by detecting the vulnerabilities using our scanning tools. First students install the OWASP Broken Web App, refer to this [CSO Online article](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3319521/learn-to-play-defense-by-hacking-these-broken-web-apps.html) for an overview of the setup process. Once the BWA is up and accessible via ZAP proxy, students will use their existing Kali Linux VM to run vulnerability scans against the BWA using Kali-native tools Vega and W3AF. It&#39;s good if students pair off and the teams present their findings at the end of the lab.

#### Day 37 - Exploiting Web App Vulnerabilities with Burp Suite

  1. Notes
    1. Today students will challenge themselves by putting themselves in the shoes of a web app security attacker and attempt to exploit common web vulnerabilities. This content aligns well with CEH, and will allow students to technically understand the vulnerabilities by performing them and thinking like the attacker. We&#39;re leaning heavily on the Portswigger free online labs.
    2. Instructor will weave lecture time with lab time, regroup, then repeat.
  2. Discussion

      1. Example of one topic:
        1. Lecture _SQL Injection_
        2. [Lab time](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs)_SQL Injection_
        3. Come together and discuss _SQL Injection_ labs
        4. Repeat for next topic
    3. Key topics - Spend significant time on these
      1. Topic 1: SQL Injection
      2. Topic 2: Cross-site scripting (XSS)
      3. Topic 3: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    4. Other topics - Move these quickly with remaining time

### Week 9 - Penetration Testing (Red Team)

Pentesting Standard Used

This week is modeled after CEH for useful certification testing alignment

Overview

Now that students are fully armed with tools and environments, this week is all about bringing skills together in the form of a fully-simulated pentest. Content this week heavily echoes that of CEH. We&#39;ll go over the usual suspects like NMAP of course, as well as following the narrative linear process of pentesting from start to finish. Some legal concerns: Students need to have full, explicit, written consent to perform this kind of activity on a real business. It&#39;s safest to have students learn in a controlled environment. There is a Linux distribution called [Metasploitable 2](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/44040-the-easiest-metasploit-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-read.pdf) we can leverage as a victim PC.

End of week deliverable:

Students will not only perform pentesting planning and activities but practice professional documentation throughout the week, culminating in a [Penetration Test Report](https://www.offensive-security.com/reports/sample-penetration-testing-report.pdf) deliverable.

Lab requirements

- Students will need a Kali Linux VM and a legal/safe target for pentesting. HackTheBox has a dozen or so targets with vulnerabilities but difficulty varies wildly. Vulnhub is another good source of targets, as is Metasploitable. There should be enough targets between the two to keep these pentesters busy.

## Deprecated/Unused Curriculum Content

1. Day 6 - Data File Encryption
2. Lab
  1. Notes
    1. This lab is designed to simulate the handling of sensitive or otherwise regulated data in a secure fashion. Scope of data is limited to single-file transfers, so we&#39;ll use SFTP servers to facilitate the process.
    2. This is a great chance to also teach password cracking, if there is time.
  2. Scenario
    1. You&#39;re sending a secret message to a colleague in the form of encrypted files
    2. Your message is a twelve-word sentence
    3. Each file must be password-encrypted
  3. Prework: Deploy a Kali Linux virtual machine on local host using VMware
    1. Install VMware Workstation Player (Free)
    2. Download Kali Linux system image from Offensive Security
    3. Open Kali Linux image in VMware Workstation Player
    4. Assign folders, setup VM
    5. Launch VM, configure Kali Linux for first time use
  4. Deploy a SFTP server in AWS
    1. Establish SSH connectivity
  5. Compose a sentence with twelve words.
    1. Example: &quot;After being chased by the predator the white rabbit jumped into bushes&quot;
  6. Create twelve .txt files; name them as File01.txt, File02.txt, etc.
  7. Open each text file in order and put one word into the file.
    1. Example: File01.txt contains the word AFTER
  8. Create a MD5 folder and put four files into it
  9. Create a SHA-1 folder and put four files into it
  10. Create a SHA-256 folder and put four files into it
  11. Password-encrypt each file.
  12. Create hash values for all files and save to MyHashes.txt
  13. For each folder, alter two of the four files
    1. Only change an attribute of the file metadata to avoid making it inaccessible
  14. Securely transmit SSH credentials to have a partner access your SFTP server
  15. Partner will download all twelve files and generate hashes
  16. Partner will attempt to determine which ones are modified and which are unmodified
  17. BONUS: Don&#39;t give your partner the passwords. They&#39;ll attempt to crack them.
  18. Can your partner decipher the secret message?
  19. Validate and document all stages
  20. Change your SFTP/SSH server access key
  21. Turn off the SFTP/SSH server
3.
  1. Business requirements analysis lab

      1. From a given case study, analyze how CIA aspects are involved/impacted
      2. What aspect did the attacker compromise? How?

    1. Write about a time when you were entrusted with something important
      1. Keep a secret
      2. Keep something from being tampered with/changed
      3. Keep something up and running
  2. Lab B - Keylogger
    1. Solution: [Hatkey](https://www.crackitdown.com/2019/03/hatkey-keylogger-kali-linux.html)
    2. Scenario: You are a cyber intelligence operative for a major government surveillance agency. You are tasked with deploying a keylogger to a victim&#39;s Windows 10 PC. Legal and ethical considerations have been analyzed and you are ready to proceed. You have infiltrated the target network and know the victim PC&#39;s IP address. Requirements:
      1. The keylogger must be fully undetectable by the victim PC
      2. The victim PC will be running antivirus
      3. The keylogger must generate a text output on your local attacker machine
    3. In a team of two, use Powershell, Python, or an existing tool to deploy a keylogger to a victim PC that achieves all scenario requirements. One PC is the victim, and must be running an antivirus. This PC&#39;s IP address is disclosed to the attacker.
    4. Stretch Goal:
      1. Configure the keylogger to detect data types:
        1. Credit card numbers
        2. Social security numbers
      2. Re-run the scenario and have the victim type bogus CC and SSN values.
      3. Demonstrate that the keylogger flags a separate alert for this data type.

        4. Pulse Secure
  2. Discussion
    1. Video - [Prof. Messer - Network Access Controls (NACs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZUHYvRFUY)
  3. Lecture
    1. Why are NACs used in enterprise environments (ref [SearchSecurity Article](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Three-reasons-to-deploy-network-access-control-products))?
      1. Restrict network resource access
      2. Traditionally used by
        1. Financial institutions
        2. High-security corporations
        3. Universities
      3. Rapidly increased adoption rate by large organizations
        1. Number of employees
        2. Contractors, visitors, and third party suppliers
      4. Mild increased adoption in small/medium sized business market
        1. Drawback - Expensive
      5. Factors driving adoption
        1. Growth of various bring-your-own-device (BYOD) and Internet-of-Things (IOT) threats
          1. IOT examples
            1. HVAC
            2. Security camera systems
          2. BYOD examples
            1. Corporate mobile devices may have MDM controls, but personal devices like cell phones generally do not
            2. Threat: APT or ransomware leaping from unsecured personal mobile device to corporate network
          3. Role-based network access (good)
            1. Integration with Active Directory controls create a seamless security configuration for IT
          4. Risk mitigation of APTs
            1. Theory: Prevent the source of APT to connect to network
            2. Case Study: [Target&#39;s 2013 infection](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/2240212369/Target-breach-update-Information-on-up-to-70-million-customers-stolen) that leveraged third party HVAC vendor to attack Target&#39;s systems
        2. &quot;The top NAC products on the market today support Apple iOS, Android and Windows devices. NAC systems can play a vital role in automatically identifying devices as they connect to the network and providing access that does not potentially compromise security. For example, when a personal mobile device connects, it can be granted access only to the Internet and not to any corporate resources. The same can be done now for IoT-enabled devices, categorizing them based on defined criteria and blocking, or creating a safe network segment, for those that are not authorized.&quot;
    2. What&#39;s a NAC?
      1. &quot;Network Access Control (NAC) Solutions are network security platforms emphasizing asset usage monitoring and restrictions and protections around sensitive data; essentially they are traffic controllers, operating on defined policy and enforcing rule-based restrictions for identity and access management and preventing cross-contamination of critical network components by unsecured endpoints. Total NAC solutions combine hardware appliances with software.&quot;
      2. Risk mitigation tool
        1. Reduce risk of compromised network file shares
    3. What NACs are used?
      1. [List of popular platforms](https://www.trustradius.com/network-access-control-nac)

## Job skills analysis

**Common job skills extracted from cyber jobs sample sets Winter 2019, Spring 2020**

This technique worked better in Ops 301, 201 because industry terminology has matured in IT, whereas cyber terminology is still being coalesced by entities such as NICE and ISC2. I noticed job postings struggled with conveying cyber concepts and often used different terms to indicate the same thing.

Another observation - for many cyber job postings, well over half the desired skills were often basic IT technician or admin skills.
