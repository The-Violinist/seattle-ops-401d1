# XSS with w3af, DVWA

## Overview

XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites. The Web Security Dojo OVA allows us to study XSS in action, then learn how web application vulnerabilty analysis can be automated using the open source scanning tool, w3af, to detect vulnerabilities like XSS.

Today you will practice the XSS (Reflected) lab in DVWA, then use w3af to scan a separate web app for vulnerabilities and document them.
